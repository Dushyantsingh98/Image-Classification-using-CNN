#CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Overview:

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels) across 10 different classes. Each class contains 6,000 images, making CIFAR-10 a well-established benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Originally created by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton, this dataset serves as a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

Classes:

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following classes-

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck

Model Details:

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
It consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers.
ReLU activation functions are used in the convolutional layers, and softmax activation is used in the output layer.
Dropout regularization is applied to prevent overfitting.
The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
The confusion matrix is visualized to understand the model's performance across different classes.

Recommendations:

To mitigate overfitting observed during training, consider adjusting dropout rates or applying stronger regularization techniques in the CNN architecture.
Improve accuracy for classes with lower performance, such as 'cat' or 'dog', by exploring class-specific data augmentation strategies or fine-tuning model parameters.
Investigate the potential benefits of transfer learning by incorporating pre-trained models to enhance classification accuracy, particularly for similar image recognition tasks.
